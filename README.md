# CPSC483_Project3

### Exploration of machine learning algorithims w/Jupyter Notebook for data analysis
In this project you will use scikit-learn, which is a higher-level machine learning library that works with NumPy data, and Pandas, a library that makes it easier to manipulate data. You will explore a variety of classification algorithms, and compare their performance on a “real-world” dataset, which will introduce its own set of challenges.
